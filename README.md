# POS tagging with Recurrent Neural Network

The purpose of this project is to compare different models based on recurrent neural architectures to perform a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging task.
The four neural networks employed are based on BiLSTM and GRU models, with final Dense layers. The experiments are runned on the 
[Dependency Treebank corpus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/corpora/dependency_treebank.zip).
